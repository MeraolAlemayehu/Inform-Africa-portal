# **Custom Portal for Social Media Data Encoding & Disinformation Analysis**  

This portal is a powerful tool designed to facilitate **manual data encoding and categorization** of social media content. It empowers researchers and data encoders to visually assess posts and systematically organize them for **disinformation detection** and **clean data analysis**. By integrating the **DISARM framework**, it ensures consistency in categorizing text, video, and metadata, laying the groundwork for deeper analytical insights. This portal is particularly valuable when **API access is unavailable**, ensuring a comprehensive approach to data collection and encoding.

## **Key Features**  

### **1. Manual Data Encoding**  
- **Content Evaluation by Humans**: Posts are meticulously reviewed by data encoders who assess tone, context, and intent, ensuring high-quality data inputs.  
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**: Supports data from **Facebook, Twitter, YouTube**, and **TikTok**, making it ideal for platforms with restricted API access.  

### **2. Categorization with the DISARM Framework**  
Encoders systematically categorize posts based on:  
- **Narrative**: Pinpoints disinformation narratives for precise identification.  
- **Target Audience**: Evaluates who the content is meant to reach and influence.  
- **Content Strategy**: Assesses messaging tactics for strategic patterns.  
- **Legitimacy**: Flags questionable or unreliable sources for further scrutiny.  

### **3. Clean Data for Advanced Analysis**  
- **High-Integrity Data**: By manually encoding content, only contextually relevant and reliable data is retained.  
- **Structured Datasets**: Outputs are optimized for analytical methods such as **sentiment analysis, topic modeling**, and **disinformation pattern detection**.  

### **4. Export Options**  
- Supports exporting in **JSON** or **CSV** formats, enabling seamless integration with external analytical tools for further research and reporting.
